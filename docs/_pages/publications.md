### Undergraduate Thesis
- **"The Impact of Wildfire Smoke on House Prices in the United States"**  
  My undergraduate thesis for Latin honors explored the effect of an additional day of wildfire smoke on house prices at the county level in the United States. Using data collected from Zillow and related research papers, I studied the relationship between wildfire smoke and house prices. Additionally, I compared the difference in the effect on counties with above-average and below-average house values.
