## Pets
My life is enriched by the companionship of wonderful pets, each with their unique personalities and quirks. Here’s a little about them:

- **Chihuahua Mix**

  Cody is our family dog, adopted when I was in 5th grade. He is a sassy boy who likes to be in charge, but is a loving guy. He brought comfort and joy during my formative years.


### Foster Dogs
- **Jack Russell Terrier**

  Mushu was our first foster pup from RHS. He was clingy in the cutest way and loved sleeping. A very curious little companion who liked to bite.

### Foster Experiences
- **Labrador-Shepherd Mix Puppy**

  Roo, our second foster pup. She was incredibly smart and silly. She kept me active with runs and her favorite thing about me was my slippers.

I love spending time with pets and find that they add a lot of happiness to my life.    Fostering has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to provide a temporary home for pets in need. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss fostering or pet care!
