Hi! Iâ€™m Tsering Sherpa, an Economics PhD student at the University of Washington.  I am a first-generation college student and the proud child of immigrants. My academic journey has been shaped by a passion for understanding development and inequality through data and applied research. In 2023, I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder, with a double major in Economics and Mathematics. 

My research focuses on development economics, applied microeconometrics, and understanding the impacts of NGOs on educational outcomes. I am particularly interested in exploring gender and education dynamics among marginalized communities.

## My Skills
- **Programming**: R, Python, Stata, MATLAB, LaTeX.
- **Econometric Techniques**: Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), limited dependent variable models (e.g., probit, tobit), regression discontinuity design (RDD), difference-in-differences (DiD), fixed and random effects models.
- **Machine Learning**: Decision trees, XGBoost, neural networks (basics), clustering (K-means), dimensionality reduction (PCA), regularization methods (LASSO, Ridge), cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning.
- **Data Analysis**: Quantitative modeling, visualization, and cleaning.

## My Interests
- **Research Areas**: Development economics, education, and gender studies.
- **Technical Skills**: Data analysis, R programming, and econometric modeling.
- **Personal Passions**: Minimalism, yoga, and finding connections between tradition and modernity.
